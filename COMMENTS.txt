typedef struct s_data
{
	char				*input;
	char				*input_copy;
	t_token				*tokens;
	t_token				*final_tokens; //to execute
	int					num_pipes; //just in case handy for execution
	t_env_node			*envs;
}						t_data;

execution functions should take data->final_tokens linked list to execute commands stored in there. data->tokens is used for initial scanning and is later compressed into final_tokens

token has the following structure:

typedef struct s_token
{
	t_token_type		type;
	// for command name
	char				*value;
	// for command flags and etc.
	char				**args;
	int					args_count;
	// for redirections
	t_redirection		*redirections_in;
	t_redirection		*redirections_out;
	struct s_token		*prev;
	struct s_token		*next;
}						t_token;

each redirection is connected to the command which can have 
TOKEN_CMD or TOKEN_BUILTIN type

each redirection has the following structure:

typedef struct s_redirection
{
	t_token_type	type;
	char			*file;
	struct s_redirection *next;
}						t_redirection;

file = filename 

there are 4 types of redirections:
	TOKEN_REDIRECT_IN,
	TOKEN_REDIRECT_OUT,
	TOKEN_APPEND,
	TOKEN_HEREDOC

heredoc is also a file stored as temporary .heredoc_file in redirection of type TOKEN_HEREDOC

in the end executor function will handle a list like 
TOKEN_CMD with value as command, with args for flags and stuff, redirections_in and _out lists 
or
TOKEN_BUILTIN with value like echo, cd and etc.
TOKEN_PIPE
TOKEN_CMD
and so on

to summarize what's not yet implemented:
- echo broke
- garbage collection as a separate thing (rn nothing is freed)
- syntax errors
- heredoc testing + heredoc $ delim expansion (maybe should be handled by execution to work with signals and etc.)
- sometimes $ should be removed but stays
- check forbidden functions: nm -g ./minishell | grep " U " (from https://github.com/jotavare/minishell)
- norminette

after execution is done:
- check if signals work with heredoc
- check if signals work while input after minishell> is written
Type a command line, then use ctrl-C and press "Enter". The buffer should be clean and there should be
nothing left to execute.
- run tester https://github.com/zstenger93/42_minishell_tester 
- try export and then command with expansion
